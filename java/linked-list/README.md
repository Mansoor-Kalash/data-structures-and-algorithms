# LinkedList
Singly Linked List linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence.

## Challenge 

create kthFromEnd method.

![whightboard](LinkedList3.png)

## Approach & Efficiency

can get the value based in postion of the node from tail to head.

time Big O ==> O(n) because use loop that debend on inpute.

space Big O =>> O(1) because the store data not depend on input and it fix.

## Api 

kthFromEnd method: accept an integer number plase from tail to head of linked List and return value in this postion on linked list.

Singly Linked List
linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence.

Challenge
creat Linked List class that contain this method:

1. append.
2. addBefore.
3. addAfter

Approach & Efficiency
can creat instance empty linked list
can add node to the empty linked list an the head will point to the last node in linked list.
can add multy node to the list and evry one will add to the last postion.

append methode :
Time Big O => O(n) use loop depend on input
Space Big O => O(1) space is fix and independent in input

addBefore methode :
Time Big O => O(n) use loop depend on input
Space Big O => O(1) space is fix and independent in input
addAfter methode :
Time Big O => O(n) use loop depend on input
Space Big O => O(1) space is fix and independent in input
API
append : add new node to linled list in last position.
addAfter : accept tow value, add the second value to the linked list before the first value.
addAfter :accept tow value, add the second value to the linked list after the first value.
