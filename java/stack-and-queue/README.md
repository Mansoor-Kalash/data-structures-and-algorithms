# Stacks and Queues

***Stack is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in first-out (LIFO) principle.***

***Queue is a container of objects (a linear collection) that are inserted and removed according to the first-in first-out (FIFO) principle.***

## Challenge

***Stack and a Queue Implementation***

**create tow classes Stack and Queue and create these methode:
### Stack class

1. push.
2. pop.
3. peek.
4. isEmpty.

### Queue Class 

1. enqueue.
2. dequeue.
3. peek.
4. isEmpty.


## Approach & Efficiency

can create instance empty object in each class. can check if the stack or queue is empty by isEmpty method.
can push multi value.
Big O time & space for all method in tow pranch big O(1).

## API

push : add value to last postion in stack.
remove : remove from the top of stack.
peack : return the valur inside the top,
isEmpty : Returns: Boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty.
dequeue : remove the first value insid queue.
peek:return the value inside the top,
is empty: check id is empty return null if rlse return fale.
